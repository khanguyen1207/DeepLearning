# DeepLearning
Deep learning experimentations and examples.

## Getting Started
There are examples in the repo of some simple deep learning models using Keras.

### Dependencies
 - `python3.6+ x64` (64 bit is important, since tensorflow only supports x64)
 - `python3 -m pip install keras`
 - Tensorflow
   - If you have a supported nVidea GPU `python3 -m pip install tensorflow-gpu` (If a version cannot be found using pip, make sure you have a 64 bit verison of python)
   - Use CPU calculating `python3 -m pip install tensorflow`
 - `python3 -m pip install numpy`
 - `python3 -m pip install matplotlib`
